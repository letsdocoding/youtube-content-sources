# PlantUML Themes Customization

This is an extension to the previous master class where we have covered the PlantUML and its usage. The Details are available here [~[https://github.com/letsdocoding/youtube-content-sources/tree/main/plantuml](https://github.com/letsdocoding/youtube-content-sources/tree/main/plantuml)]

In this video we shall discuss and understand how we can add colors and themes and also basics of how it works under the hoods. With this we can change the basic diagram that looks like below into further variants.
